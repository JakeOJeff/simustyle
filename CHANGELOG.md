# Change log

Record meaningful project changes during the event, newest first.

## Event build log

### 2026-10-10T22:33:18+05:30 — Record the implementation checkpoint

- Changed: Recorded the implementation commit SHA and clarified it should be updated if the code changes before submission. Files: `SUBMISSION.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and `AI_USAGE.md`.
- Why: Make the demo's code reference reviewable while keeping the submission details tied to the implementation that was committed.
- Validation: Confirmed the recorded SHA with `git log`; checked the repository status after the implementation commit.
- Limitations: Participant names and the organizers' final submission method remain unknown and need the team's input.

### 2026-10-10T22:27:55+05:30 — Build the scene parser MVP

- Changed: Added the Node.js CLI and HTTP API, OpenAI Responses API integration, scene prompt construction, runtime component registry support, local operation validation, and setup/demo documentation. Files: `package.json`, `src/cli.js`, `src/openai.js`, `src/prompts.js`, `src/server.js`, `src/validate.js`, `README.md`, `AI_USAGE.md`, and `SUBMISSION.md`.
- Why: Turn plain-language scene edits into safe-to-review JSON operations for a host simulation.
- Validation: `npm run check` passed. A Node smoke check accepted a valid operation, rejected an unsupported field, and rejected a dangling scene parent. A local HTTP smoke check passed `/health` and confirmed malformed scene input returns HTTP 400.
- Limitations: Live generation requires an OpenAI API key and is unverified here. Script compilation and simulator application are outside this MVP.

## Template setup — 10 October 2026

- Changed: Added the event README, rules, agent guide, change log, AI usage record, submission checklist, Git ignore rules, and pull request checklist.
- Why: Give participants a consistent starting point for event rules, basic coding patterns, documented changes, and regular commits.
- Validation: Checked local Markdown links, event detail consistency, required documents, and diff whitespace before publishing.
- Limitations: Documentation scaffolding only; no participant project, application, or working demo was included at template setup.
